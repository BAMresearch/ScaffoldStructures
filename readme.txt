This app was originally developed by J.C. Dinis at Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, Marinha Grande, Portugal.

The software is open-source and available under GPL2.0.
The software was tested with Python 3.5 under Ubuntu 16.04. 

Open the folder in Terminal and run it with: python3 app.py


I plan to provide working executables for Linux and Windows in the future.
